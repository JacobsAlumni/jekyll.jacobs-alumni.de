# JacobsAlumniWebsite
A [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) version of the of the Jacobs University Alumni Organisation Website.
Designed from the ground up to be responsive and url-compatible with the [legacy website](https://github.com/JacobsAlumni/legacy.jacobs-alumni.de).

## Building
```
  jekyll serve
```

## Structure

- Content is located under `src/` and has `permalink` attributes
- Media (where absolutely needed) is under `media/`. We keep this as small as possible, and out-source to Google Photos / Imgur.
