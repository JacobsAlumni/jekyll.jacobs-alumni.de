### Mentoring Program

__What is it?__

The Mentoring Program connects current Jacobs students (mentees) and Jacobs Alumni (mentors). In a semi-structured program spanning ~11 months, alumni contribute their experience and time to students and provide advice in different areas of life after Jacobs. 

__How do I get involved?__

Check the Mentor box in your Alumni Portal account or e-mail the Jacobs Career Services Coordinator Christin Klähn at [c.klaehn@jacobs-university.de](mailto:c.klaehn@jacobs-university.de). 

### Chapters

__What is it?__

Chapters are little Jacobs bubbles all over the world. 
Led by usually two alumni, they connect Jacobs Alumni in one city/region or with a common interest, providing a platform to ask questions, meet up, reconnect, and help each other.
There are three types of alumni chapters: local chapters, club chapters, subject chapters.
At the moment, most chapters are organized as Facebook or WeChat groups. 

__How do I get involved?__

Check out the page on [Alumni Chapters](/chapters/) for more detailed information.
Most Alumni Chapters can be joined by searching on Facebook for "Jacobs Alumni Chapter ...".
If you do not find your chapter - or even would like to found your own one - get in touch with the [Assessor for Network Development](/board/) of the Alumni Board.
