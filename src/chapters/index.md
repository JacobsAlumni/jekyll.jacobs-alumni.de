Alumni chapters are groups of alumni who share a common ground and come together to foster the Jacobs network.
As such chapters form the hubs of the alumni network, where alumni not only stay in touch but also forge new connections.
They are about keeping the spirit of our university alive by supporting each other a life long wherever we are on the globe.
In this manner they also spread the name of our university all over the world.
The common goals of all alumni chapters are the following.

* Build and reinforce a network among alumni based on opportunities for growth, exchange and support on a personal, professional and social level.
* Help in promoting the unique character of the university and ensure a continuous commitment of alumni to the university and its long-term advancement, through support for current students and other activities.

Every Alumni Chapter has a Chapter Leader who serves as a contact point for both members and the board of the Alumni Association.
The specific common grounds Alumni Chapters are based, can in principle be very diverse.
However, there are three basic types of chapters. 

### Local Chapters

Local chapters are groups of alumni living in a certain geographical area, who come together and live the Jacobs network locally.
They are the physical meeting point away from Jacobs.
Local chapters act as a first point of contact not only for new alumni in a particular area, but also for current students located in the area temporarily, e.g. for their internships.
Currently there are the following local chapters:

#### Africa

1. Addis Ababa
2. West Africa

#### America

1. Boston
2. Canada
3. Chicago
4. New York City 
5. San Francisco
6. Seattle
7. Washington DC

#### Asia

1. Mumbai
2. South Asia

#### Australia

1. Australia/Oceania

#### Europe

1. Austria 
2. Amsterdam
3. Belgium 
4. Berlin 
5. Bremen 
6. Brussels 
7. Bucharest
8. Cambridge
9. Cologne
10. Copenhagen/Malmö
11. Dublin 
12. Edinburgh
13. Frankfurt
14. Göttingen
15. Hamburg
16. Italy
17. London
18. Munich
19. Netherlands
20. North Rhine Westphalia
21. Nuremberg
22. Oslo/Norway
23. Oxford
24. Paris
25. Sofia
26. Switzerland 

### Club chapters

Club chapters are groups of alumni who have been part of a particular club on campus and want to continue supporting them.
The members of club chapters stay informed on the activities and events of the club, receiving invitations to participate and get involved.
The chapter leader maintains an even closer connection to the club itself. 

Currently, there are two club chapters:

1. J-Capella Alumni
2. Rowing Alumni

### Subject chapters

Subject chapters are digital platforms on defined subjects such as majors, causes or careers.
The members of a subject chapter share a common interest in one topic.
The focus of those chapters is not on physically meeting but on discussing the common topic and sharing content on it. The chapter leader also functions as a moderator here. 

Currently, there are the following subject chapters:

1. Alumni Consulting
2. BCCB/Life Sciences
3. ESS
4. GEM
5. IPH/IRPH
6. ISCP/Psychology
7. ISS
8. Logistics
9. Physics

### How to join an Alumni Chapter?

Most Alumni Chapters can be joined by searching on Facebook for "Jacobs Alumni Chapter ...".
If you do not find your chapter - or even would like to found your own one -, get in touch with the Assessor for Network Development of the Alumni Board.
We are working on streamlining the processes related to Alumni Chapters to make it easier for you to find and join them.

## How to start an Alumni Chapter?

Starting a local chapter is ridiculously easy!
Just gather the people in your area, start a Facebook group named "[Jacobs Alumni Chapter XYZ](https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=jacobs%20alumni%20chapter&epa=SEARCH_BOX)" and organize your first event or discussion.
Afterwards, fill in the registration form and send it per email to the [Assessor for Network Development](/board/) and tell us that you exist.
Done!

Basically done.
Starting an Alumni Chapter is very simple, keeping it alive a bit more challenging.
To achieve longer-term success, we recommend the following when starting an Alumni Chapter:

1. Do coordinate with the Assessor for Network Development.
The role of this position includes the support and the development of Alumni Chapters.
2. There should be at least five alumni as members including one chapter leader.
There are several options to find alumni to join a chapter:
  - Use the keyword search function of the [Alumni Atlas](https://portal.jacobs-alumni.de/atlas/) to find alumni according to location, major etc.
  - Use the Facebook [graph search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_Graph_Search) to find Facebook friends or even friends of friends.
  - Make a general call in the Facebook group "[Jacobs University Alumni](https://www.facebook.com/groups/119890224726756/)"
3. The Local Chapter Leader should be planning to stay longer in the area.
It does not make sense to have a leader for less than one year.
Moreover, the leader should know the city or area well.
In case of a club or subject chapter, the leader should have a strong and visible connection, e.g. former club membership.
4. Sharing a yearly plan of activities with the Assessor for Network Development and the chapter at the beginning of the (academic) year, can be very beneficial.
The assessor can support in the organization and advertisement, for example.
In case of local chapters for example, the cycle of events can be nicely started with having a welcome event for new graduate students at the beginning of fall semester.


## Frequently Asked Questions

### How can I join an Alumni Chapter?

In order to join an Alumni Chapter, you have to get in touch with chapter leader.
The contact details are available on this website. 
If you are only staying in a certain city or area temporarily, simply join the Facebook page of the Alumni Chapter to get in touch with fellow alumni and join their events.

### How do I know which alumni live in my area?

The new [Alumni Atlas](https://portal.jacobs-alumni.de/atlas/) offers a search function to find out about where alumni live.
As this is dependent on up-to-date date, Facebook can also be very helpful here.
Typing in "My friends who live in Stuttgart" in the search field, will give you a list of Facebook friends living in that city. 
"Friends of friends" will even give you second-order connections.

### How do I know what Alumni Chapters exists so far?

While the Alumni Association aims at keeping track of all Alumni Chapters, new chapters might not always be on this website very quickly.
A good way to find out about chapters is by searching Facebook with the keywords "Jacobs Alumni Chapter". 
Facebook will auto-complete the search and suggest all the existing alumni chapters.

### Can I get any funding for the chapter from the university?

Currently, there is no possibility to get any funding neither from the university nor the Alumni Association.
However, with the implementation of membership fees for alumni in the association the situation is very likely to change in the near future.

### How can I motivate people if they don’t show up for events?

There can be many reasons for a low turnout for a certain event.
And it can get frustrating, especially if a lot of effort has gone into organising the event.
In general it is beneficial to create a sense of liability among the participants, for example by creating a Doodle, making a reservation for a certain number of people, or setting a deadline for confirmations and cancellations.
In any case a good communication is vital.

### What do I do if I notice the local chapter leader is not doing a good job?

First you might want to address the local chapter leader directly and even offer to help out.
If that still doesn’t work, contact the [Assessor for Event Management](/board/) about your problem.
The assessor can talk to the chapter leader and push for change.

### What if there is a local chapter in my area or region, but not in my city?

If there are more than five alumni in your city, go ahead and start a local chapter there as well.
If not, you might want to get in touch with the existing chapter in your area and ask them to organise meetings and events also in your city.
