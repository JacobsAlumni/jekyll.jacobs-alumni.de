## Welcome

The Homecoming Organization Committee is excited to welcome you for this year's Homecoming from 20-22<sup>nd</sup> of September 2019 on campus.
The Homecoming Committee, Alumni Office, and Alumni Board are working hard to create an unforgettable weekend, by recreating your Jacobian experience in just three days.

This year is especially memorable, as we will welcome three reunion classes back to campus for the first time.
Class of 2004, our pioneers, class of 2009, and class of 2014 will be celebrating their 15th, 10th and 5th anniversaries during this year’s Homecoming Weekend.

Many aspects will remain as in earlier years, most notably the combination of Open Lectures, Homecoming with the Career Symposium on Friday.
We are anticipating the highest attendance rate at this year’s Gala Dinner, which will be hosted at the Strandlust Hotel in Vegesack.
Like last year, the dinner will be open to all alumni, regardless of their graduating class.
As it was last year, the Alumni Association General Assembly will start Saturday afternoon – allowing all of us to enjoy a calm Saturday morning on campus at the Major Reunion Breakfasts, and to be well rested for the big Homecoming party on Saturday night, recreating the biggest parties of co 2004, 2009 and 2014.
Please note that the general assembly will be live-streamed. 
More information can be found on the [livestream page](/archived/).

## Can I get accommodation on campus?

Unfortunately, this year there is no on-campus accommodation available.
Due to growth in student numbers, even the Guest House and the new college Krupp E are fully booked.
__If you decide to be a guest at any student’s dorm, be sure that the student informs the security team in advance!__

## What about accommodation off-campus?

Check out our hotel contingencies above!
You can of course book accommodation in any hotel there is in Bremen, preferably well advance, as rooms are booked out quickly.
We encourage you to also get in touch with your former host family in Bremen.
Maybe you can arrange a night or two with them.

## I am staying not too close to campus. Can I store luggage and change on campus?

Since this year there will not be any on-campus accommodation available due to the large incoming student batch, we are making every effort to mitigate any inconveniences caused especially for those staying further away from campus.
In particular, on Saturday there are two dress codes, casual for the day and formal for the evening, and going back to your hotel to change might not be feasible.
We put a slot in which you can change, from after the General Assembly at 16:30 to the beginning of the Gala Danner at 18:30.
However, if this is to short you can bring the outfit for the evening to campus (or any other belongings) and store it in the Campus Center Basement Rooms (just next to the mailboxes and the bathrooms), which is open between 10:00 and 20:00.
We will have hostesses there in charge of looking after your belongings.
You can change in the bathrooms there or go over to the Sports & Convention Center and use its changing rooms.
Any stuff that you want to leave for the night, you can leave there, which will be closed for the night and re-opened the following morning.
You may also bring any belongings to the party, which has a cloakroom set up.
Please note that any of those storing services are at your own risk and that we cannot be held liable for any damage or loss that might occur to your belongings.

## Where can I get my Welcome Package and what is in it?

The Welcome Packages will be ready in the foyer of the foyer of the university Campus Center.
If you are arriving late, you can also pick them up Saturday.
The package will include your wristband for the BBQ, Gala Dinner and party, meal vouchers, printouts of all schedules.
