title: Have Contribution Fees made a difference?
subtitle: Yes, a huge one! 
---

In 2018, revenue from Contribution Fees equaled the amount we received from one-time donations from Alumni, therefore, now they account for 50% of our revenue.
Our Donations and Contribution Fees in 2018 are almost double what Donations alone were in 2015!
This is amazing progress in our fundraising efforts only in 3 years.

The revenue we receive from Contribution Fees and Donations every year now covers our basic running costs but, more importantly, enables us to give out at least one 9,000 EUR scholarship per year consistently for the foreseeable future.
In a few years, we might even be able to start giving out two scholarships per year and look into additional Alumni and/or Jacobs-related causes to support.
Being able to grant scholarships every year consistently also establishes us as an important stakeholder in the eyes of Jacobs University and gives us more leverage to influence the direction the University will go into in the future.
