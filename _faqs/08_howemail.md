All Jacobs Alumni are welcome to apply to join the Alumni Association if they fulfil the conditions described in our Charter (see: 4. Who is a Member of the Alumni Association e.V.?).
Alumni are also welcome to register for the free Starter Tier if they are not able or not willing to contribute to the Association via Contribution Fees. 
The access to the use of an @jacobs-alumni.de email address is one of the many perks of being a member of the Alumni Association e.V.
