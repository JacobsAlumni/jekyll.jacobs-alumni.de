title: What are Contribution Fees for Members?
subtitle: As described in our Charter each member can choose to pay Membership Fees (Contribution Fees). 
---

Contribution Fees are based on the following three tiers:
- Starter - 0 EUR per year for a starting duration of 2 years (after the initial 2-year period elapses, the member will be prompted to choose an alternative tier, Contributor or Patron, or may apply for an 1-year extension of the Starter tier; the extension can be requested repetitively)
- Contributor - 39 EUR per year - payment details will be collected upon registration and selection of the Contributor tier and if no membership cancellation occurs, the membership contribution fee will be collected annually (after a notification)
- Patron - 249 EUR per year - payment details will be collected upon registration and selection of the Patron tier and if no membership cancellation occurs, the membership contribution fee will be collected annually (after a notification)

Here is some background and history about the Membership Fees:

In 2015, following a discussion started in 2008 and a provision existing from the very first version of the Alumni Charter, the Association adopted a fee-based contribution structure for all members, in order to raise more funds and be financially-independent from Jacobs University.
This enabled us to have a steady revenue stream to support our operations (database development, tax attorney fees, etc.) and to also give out more scholarships.
The changes were supported and voted into force by the Association's General Assembly in September 2015.
The implementation of the membership fees was firstly included in the relaunch of AlmaLink in August 2016 and then optimized with the new Membership Portal active from December 2017.

All revenue from Fundraising and Contribution Fees goes towards the nonprofit purpose of the AA as outlined in our Charter.
This happens directly via scholarships, for example, or indirectly through financing the Associationâ€™s operations and ensuring its effective work toward fulfilling its purpose and goals.
All expenses are independently audited by internal Auditors who are elected from the members and by external tax consultants with whom we submit the financial reports to the authorities.
The Annual Financial Report is presented to all members at the annual General Assembly where it is approved as part of the Board's Annual Report.
