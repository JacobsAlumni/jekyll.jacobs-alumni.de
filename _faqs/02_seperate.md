title: Why is the Alumni Association a separate e.V. from the University?
subtitle: We want the Alumni Association to be independent of the University. 
---

We believe it is important that the Alumni Association is an organization independent of the University, including an independence of the university's financial, personnel, and strategy decisions.
The choice for an e.V. ("eingetragener Verein") was made because it bears the lowest fixed legal costs in comparison to other legal forms of clubs (to the best of our knowledge so far).
Lastly, it also allows the Alumni Association to obtain nonprofit status (*Gemeinn√ºzigkeit*), which is helpful for serving the Association's purpose: acting as stewards of the Jacobs spirit and ensuring that future generations can have the same great Jacobs experience as we did.

Please see Figure 1 for the ownership structure and relationship between Jacobs University Alumni Association e.V. and other stakeholders.
