title: What do I do if I cannot access my email anymore?
subtitle: We want to sincerely apologize if some of you have been unable to access your emails since January 1st, 2019.

Maybe we did not manage to communicate clearly enough that access to some email accounts will be suspended on January 1st, 2019.
We know that some of you missed the emails we sent out warning you that you need to register by December 31st, 2018 on the Alumni Portal.
They were only sent out to affected users to their Alumni accounts which we understand not everyone checks regularly.
Naturally, we would like to offer you a solution!

The fastest and easiest thing to do is to head over to portal.jacobs-alumni.de and register.
Your membership will be confirmed and your email account reactivated as soon as possible.
