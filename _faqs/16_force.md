title: Am I being forced to pay for my Alumni email address?
subtitle: Absolutely not!

Your membership contribution is not tied in any way to your email address, but your membership is.
We believe membership in the Association should be accessible to all Jacobs Alumni irrespective of their ability to pay the contribution fees.
Therefore, while we encourage Alumni who have already spent 2 years in the Starter Tier to sign up or upgrade to Contributor (39 EUR/year) or Patron (249 EUR/year), we will ALWAYS have the free membership tier for those who are not able to contribute financially.

We want to remind you that 100% of all Contribution Fees go either towards supporting Jacobs students with scholarships, who otherwise would not be able to attend Jacobs University, or to help support programs like the Alumni Database, networking programs, tax attorney fees, etc.
Moreover, as a member, be that Starter, Contributor or Patron, you will have the opportunity to take part in other initiatives such as the Mentorship Program, our annual General Assembly, where we make all decisions for the Association, or enjoy various member benefits.
