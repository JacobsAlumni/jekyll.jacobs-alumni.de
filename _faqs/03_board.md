title: What is the Alumni Board?
subtitle: We are alumni volunteers!
---

As an independent entity of Jacobs University, the Jacobs Alumni Association e.V. is run by a Board of 8-12 members at any given time.
We are very much an operational Board and not a typical supervisory one.
We do a lot of small things like replying to your emails, resetting your passwords, posting on Facebook, but also we do a lot of big things like having a permanent seat on the Jacobs Board of Governors, where we participate in shaping Jacobs University's development and strategy!
Together with your input, we play a key role in shaping the long-term direction of the University as outlined in the Cooperation Agreement signed by the Association, Jacobs University and the Jacobs Foundation in 2018.
But most importantly, we are Jacobs Alumni just like YOU aiming to encourage the growth of our community!
We also work very closely with the Alumni Relations Office (ARO) at Jacobs University who help us with day-to-day operations as well as planning and strategy.
