If you prefer to just check your emails and not participate in any of our other programs like Homecoming, the Mentorship Program, free Career Services, etc., that is up to you.
However, we are very much looking forward to reaching out to you and trying to engage our Alumni base in order to keep building the spirit of Jacobs Alumni beyond our time on campus.
We would love to learn from you and try to find new ways of how we can be of value to __YOU__!
