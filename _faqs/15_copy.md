If you do not want to be a member of the Association, we are sorry to hear that and we are happy to grant you temporary access to your Google Apps account for 2 weeks so you can export any data you want.
Please email us at [membership@jacobs-alumni.de](mailto:membership@jacobs-alumni.de) with this request.
