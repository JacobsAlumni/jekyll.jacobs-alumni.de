title: Why did the Alumni Association e.V. suspend some email accounts on January 1st, 2019 after all these years? 
subtitle: As the number of Association members started growing exponentially and the Association is continuously becoming more professional, the burden of managing two seperate databases with different membership bases was too large and confusing.

We want to make sure everyone who has an alumni email address is also a member of the Association, properly registered through the Alumni Portal.

The need to professionalize and clean up our membership structure was also precipitated by our non-profit status renewal at the end of 2018.
In order to make sure all Alumni with alumni email address are registered as members of the Association, we started sending out emails to all @jacobs-alumni.de email addresses we had on file to ask them to (re-)register on the Alumni Portal.
We sent out 3 such emails over the span of a few months.
We also warned users that their @jacobs-alumni.de email addreses would be suspended on January 1st, 2019 if they had not register on the Alumni Portal by that date.

The Alumni Portal is a proprietary platform for Membership Management the Association developed.
This powerful platform will enable such programs as the Alumni Mentorship program, the Alumni Atlas, and a lot more data-driven projects.
Of course, the amount of information you wish to fill into your profile and share with others is completely up to you.
We simply want to gather reliable data which would enable us to develop features that deliver genuine value for all Alumni.
