The Jacobs Alumni Association has existed since the very first class of students graduated in 2004 as an *eingetragener Verein (e.V.) - Registered Association*. 
The Jacobs Alumni Association e.V. is an independent, non-profit association whose purpose it is to advance education, science and research, including providing support to Jacobs students. 
The main goal of the Association is to be a steward of the Jacobs University vision and spirit throughout the world and to be able to give back to younger generations with time, expertise and financial resources.

The Alumni Association consists of: 
- Members (voters)
- Associated Members (non-voters)
- General Assembly (GA) (decision-making subset of members at a given time, usually convened at Homecoming every year) 
- Board (representative body that can make certain decisions)
