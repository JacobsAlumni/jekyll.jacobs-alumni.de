title: How does Jacobs University process alumni data? Why do I receive emails from the University after registering for the Alumni Association, and/or why do I receive emails from the University although I am not a member of the Alumni Association?
subtitle: As mentioned in the current <a href="/documents/privacy/" target="blank">Privacy Policy</a>, the data sent to the Association via membership registration (with the exception of payment data) is shared with the Alumni Relations Office at Jacobs University, which is then allowed to further share the information only with the departments of Business Solutions, Student Marketing & Recruitment, Academic Services, Academic Operations, Corporate Services, Campus Operations and Corporate Staff (this happens within the scope of consent granted, inter alia for networking or communication purposes). 
---

Neither the Alumni Association nor the Alumni Relations Office nor the other departments are allowed to further share your data with the Student Financial Services department or to third parties outside of the University. 

Independent from the Alumni Association, the University has received contact data from individual Alumni on different occasions.
This data is not shared with any third parties outside of the University (including the Alumni Association) without consent.

Because of the plurality of the actors involved and the implementation of the data protection regulation, it can happen then that an alumnus/a receives communication from the different institutions on the basis of the data currently shared with them.
For example, a member of the Alumni Association can receive emails from the Alumni Association, the Alumni Relations Office or the other departments mentioned above because of the contact details collected by the Alumni Association; on the other hand, he or she may also receive emails from Student Financial Services in the case there is an open communication with them, even though the Alumni Relations Office and the Alumni Association are not informed in any way about that. 

Similarly, a non-member does not receive communication provided by the Alumni Association or the Alumni Relations Office, but he or she might be independently in touch with the University because of his or her correspondence with another department (e.g. Student Financial Services).
