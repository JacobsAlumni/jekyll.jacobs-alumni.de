title: Is anyone who has a Jacobs Alumni email address a Member of the Alumni Association e.V.? 
subtitle: No. There used to be a lot of Alumni who had Alumni email addresses but they never went through the current application process outlined on the Alumni Portal. 
---

In the past during the transition of the email management system from Jacobs University IT to the Alumni Association, some alumni might have been assigned an email address but not have gone through a registration process for membership in the Alumni Association.
When Jacobs University IT handed over the email management to the Alumni Association e.V. we got a list of 1,000+ email addresses.
At the time, we considered all these email aliases as our members.
For most of these entries, we only had names and Graduation Classes.
When we migrated to Google for nonprofits G-Suite, we noticed that the majority of Alumni had never logged into their emails.

Therefore, there was a discrepancy between accounts we had in the Alumni Portal and G-Suite. Not everyone in G-Suite (owners of alumni email addresses) went through the process of registering for the Association in our Alumni Portal.
Therefore, since some Alumni never did register for the Association or registered long before the current application process, we would kindly ask you to re-confirm your interest in being a member of the Association and re-registering at [portal.jacobs-alumni.de](https://portal.jacobs-alumni.de) so we can consider you a member (and grant you access to your Alumni email address).
