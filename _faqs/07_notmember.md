title: What happens if I graduated from Jacobs but I am not a member of the Alumni Association e.V.?
subtitle: Jacobs University and the Alumni Association are looking forward to cultivating relations with all graduates regardless of their membership status. 
---

Since the University recognizes the Alumni Association as the official organization of its former students, and the Alumni Association is a shareholder of the University through the Alumni & Friends GmbH, both institutions are committed to supporting each other within a comprehensive cooperation framework (see Figure 1 from the GA 2018 presentation). 

In this regard, they work together, e.g. to foster a broad membership of the Jacobs graduates in the Association, to promote the participation of the Associationâ€™s members in events on campus or to offer further dedicated services and benefits.
To be sure, the graduates who are currently not members of the Association are invited to join University events such as the Career Fair, Career Symposium or Alumni Homecoming as well as to volunteer in the Mentoring Program or for the activities in Student Marketing, and can benefit from services such as career counselling within the available capacities.
